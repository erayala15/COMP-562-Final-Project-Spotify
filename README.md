# Introduction
The aim of this machine learning project is to develop a model that can predict the genre of a song using audio features obtained from the Spotify API. The project involves collecting audio features for a number of songs, including features related to rhythm, melody, and timbre. These features are then used to train our machine learning algorithm, which is capable of classifying songs into five different genres. The project also involves evaluating the performance of the model using an accuracy score. The results of the project have potential applications in music recommendation systems, music streaming services, and music analysis.

This machine learning project focuses on creating a model capable of identifying a song's genre using audio characteristics sourced from the Spotify API. It entails gathering audio data for various songs, using aspects from each song such as rhythm, melody, and timbre. This data is then utilized to train our machine learning algorithm, designed to categorize songs into five distinct genres. Additionally, the project includes assessing the model's effectiveness through an accuracy score. The outcomes of this project could be beneficial in the realms of music recommendation services, music streaming platforms, and the analysis of music.
