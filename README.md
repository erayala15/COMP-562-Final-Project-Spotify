# Introduction
This machine learning project focuses on creating a model capable of identifying a song's genre using audio characteristics sourced from the Spotify API. It entails gathering audio data for various songs, using aspects from each song such as rhythm, melody, and timbre. This data is then utilized to train our machine learning algorithm, designed to categorize songs into five distinct genres. Additionally, the project includes assessing the model's effectiveness through an accuracy score. The outcomes of this project could be beneficial in the realms of music recommendation services, music streaming platforms, and the analysis of music.
